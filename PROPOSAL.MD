# Final Turn, the Card Game

## Description and Motivation
Final Turn will be an online card game where users compete their cards against other players. The game will feature
deck customization, 2-player games, tracking of W/L ratios, and some basic visuals. We wanted to show off our skills with Channels and Websockets by creating a browser-based turn based game.

## Prior Art
Yu-Gi-Oh is definitely the biggest inspiration for this card game. Many of the core concepts apply here, although there are core differences, like how our cards have hit points, rather than being destroyed in one hit.

## Core User Workflows
By the end of the week, users will be able to do the following:
- Sign up, Login, and Logout
- Send, Accept, and Unfriend other people 
- Leaderboards 
- Connect to and create game lobbies (Home page will show open game lobbies)
- Battle with other players (win state when 1 player runs out of Life Points)
  -
